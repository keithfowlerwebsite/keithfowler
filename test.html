  <i style="text-align: center; padding: auto;">"Keith is an amazing instructor: thoughtful, organized and insightful.  He always comes with a lesson plan after soliciting input -- not surprising since he is a classroom teacher.  He is very analytical and can pinpoint exactly what is wrong and can offer simple, concrete steps to address the issue.  Most of all, he brings joyfulness and positivity to the game, always reminding me to just have fun.  Keith is a fabulous player and person.  He has helped me significantly level up my game.  I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him!"

  <i style="text-align: center; padding: auto;">"I am a 66 year old female, recently retired, and started playing pickleball in January 2023. Keith
    was referred to me by one of my trainers and I had a private lesson with him in June 2023.
    Keith was very efficient, tuned into my strengths and weaknesses and offered drills to improve
    my skills. Keith brought balls and special markers which were used for ball placement on
    various spots on the court. He gave me specific suggestions to improve my serve, dinking,
    backhand and volley. Keith was very engaging, supportive and encouraging. Keith told me why
    the drills were important and explained some tactics to improve my play. I really enjoyed the
    lesson, his charming accent and his pleasant personality. I got so much from the private lesson
    and my game has improved. At the end of the lesson, he even wrote a summary of the skills we
    focused on so that I could practice them after the lesson. Keith is a top notch instructor and
    could work with students of any age. I have nothing but praise for Keithâ€™s expertise and ability
    to help someone improve their pickleball game."

<i style="text-align: center; padding: auto;">"I decided to take a pickleball lesson from Keith Fowler even though I was a well seasoned racquetball player of many years
  and thought I knew everything there was to know about this game. Keith quickly evaluated my mechanics and preparation
  for returning the ball. He improved my footwork, positioning and my general mechanics of movement in one lesson, enough 
  that it was obviously better the next time I played. I also felt like I was not working as hard but still covering my opponents' shots. He introduced some drills and techniques to work on to further my improvement. Overall Keith is attentive, very knowledgeable and pleasant to work with. I highly recommend having a few lessons with him for those who wish to improve their game."

  <i style="text-align: center; padding: auto;">"I've taken two private lessons with Keith and I'm looking forward to my third. I consider myself an advanced beginner or a low intermediate but with Keith's help I know I'll grow.   He is very positive when he instructs,  making me feel confident.  He knows so many great helpful ways to help me improve my pickleball skills and he really watches me carefully to help with what I need.  Keith even has helped me hit powerful balls which I never thought I could do.  I leave the lesson happy and wanting to use all my newfound skills."
